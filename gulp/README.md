# Gulp4 for Scss, Babel and BrowserSync

A Bootstrap boilerplate with Gulp4 for Scss, Babel and BrowserSync, optimized for Japanese contents.  
For other languages, modify `lang` in **index.html** and `font-family` in **_variables.scss**.  
Ah yeh, also minifies images, of course ;)

## Installation

```bash
yarn
```

## Development

```bash
yarn dev
```

Super easy!
